							<p> Everyone came to the meetings on time and gave their input of what we should do and what tasks should be allocated till the next meeting. Working together wasn’t struggling as most of us were always in communication through discord and ms teams. Coming to a team consensus on the project idea wasn’t struggling at all, as everyone brainstormed ideas together and compared them. Even though tasks were given to each other, sometimes we weren’t able to complete them on time, leading us to panic at the last minute. For the next assignment, we could improve on completing tasks on time by starting the project earlier and setting realistic goals for the next agenda. When doing the project idea, I was surprised about getting an early concept of the medical chatbot to function on our discord channel. This was a challenge at first, as many YouTube tutorials were outdated when explaining the bot and how tricky it is to understand the logic behind it. However, working together, we were able to get something going. Being in my final year of university, working in a group has been the norm for me, and my past experiences have helped me adapt easier to a new environment. I learned that working together as a group can be challenging, but if everyone can get comfortable with each other and express their opinions, groups can be quite enjoyable.

							<p> Throughout assignment 2, our team had about 11 meetings, and all the team members were present. Although we divided the load equally early on, team members agreed to schedule frequent appointments to assist one another. Overall, the assignment process went smoothly as we finalised our parts in time. The team was lost as many of our original ideas were too complex for us to work with. We spent two meetings just working on developing new ideas. This could be easily fixed by adequately discussing with the lecturer during our chat to determine what we might need to know to proceed with specific ideas. None of our team members knew how to code python properly at the start of the assignment, but we managed to build a working chatbot using multiple online resources. So far, frequent meetings and status updates have worked out well for our team as they help us get to know each other as we work on our projects. I also learned that contributing to the conversations helps us widen our vision as communication plays a significant role in a team environment.

							<p> We were able to delegate parts of the assignment amongst ourselves, which helped us complete the assignment faster, organise meetings that were attended, and we were able to mostly follow the agenda of goals for each meeting.
The agenda could have been improved - sometimes the agenda for one meeting had too many goals that could not be accomplished quickly.
One thing that was surprising was that even though we did not know how to code python at the start of this assignment, we were eventually able to create a functioning chatbot by following various youtube tutorials.
I learned that having a lot of meetings, and creating an agenda beforehand enabled our group to make more progress on completing our assignment.

Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment:
We marked our progress on our assignment through a Word document (instead of using Github to log how we were progressing on our assignment) that listed our aims from each meeting, what goals were completed in the meeting, and future goals for the next meeting

							<p> We had over 10 meetings and more spontaneuous undocumented meetings on discord to discuss and work on the tasks we distributed to each other. Overall we managed to complete all the work on time without any hindrance due to communicating well and consistently.


	With a high workload  this week, it was hard to meet task deadlines. There were many stressful situations of multitasking to meet deadlines. We need to make our tasks more realistic by breaking them down into smaller tasks and distributing them freely.




I have worked in teams before and there were many issues that arise from working together, however our team surprisingly did not have such issues. Everyone was understanding and coordinated well to finish the work.


Creating agendas and strategizing on meetings beforehand allowed us to progress faster. This allowed us time to work on harder sections of the project.

							<p> The highlight of the assignment for me was my team members, who all really got along well and allowed each other to better manage our time and work to meet goals and deadlines. Everyone has really put in the work and contributed to the assignment well; working to each other's strengths and knowledge.

We could have better improved our organization during the earlier stage, as I’ve noticed everyone had assignments piling on as we fell somewhat behind with this assignment; starting early and staying ahead would be an improvement we should work towards in the future.

I was surprised with the amount of work we were able to put in outside of class and meetings. Understanding my group members other obligations and busy schedules I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of work we had agreed on and followed through.

When working in group assignments, I’ve always used this as an opportunity to exercise soft skills to coexist and work with others. In this particular assignment I’ve learned more about my team members and IT in general from everyone's own personal interest, knowledge and different perspectives. Often shared in our meetings.
