							<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What does it do? </p>
							<p> Cyber security refers to the standards, technological answers and procedures that are utilised to help defend your device and network from any digital attacks - and therefore protect your personal data from unauthorised access, as well as prevent damage to your system (Microsoft security n.d.). </p>
							<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? </p>
							<p> Behavioural analytics (also called UEBA, User and Entity Behavioural Analytics) is a new cyber security technology (Simmons 2022): <br> <br>
Behavioural analytics refers to machine learning algorithms which show how people act on systems, websites, networks and apps, in order to determine patterns in behaviour (also called a behaviour profile). It is employed by cyber security professionals, since strange occurrences and actions that deviate from usual patterns in behaviour can be used to identify possible vulnerabilities and threats that were not detected by protective technologies (Simmons 2022). It is also used alongside SIEM (Security Information Event Management), which prioritises sending out major security alerts (Serna 2022).<br> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/behavioral-analytics.jpg" alt="" /></span> <br>
Behavioural analytics can be used to detect abnormal quantities of data coming from one device – potentially indicating that a cyberattack is currently occurring or will likely happen (Simmons 2022). It can also be used to recognise malicious activity via it finding oddly timed events and actions happening in a strange order and determine if other devices have been accessed and infected (Simmons 2022). <br> <br>
When an analyst establishes what unusual behaviours to include in events for UEBA, they have to think of the possible indicators of intent, create behaviour outcomes for each indicator, and then convert each scenario into a rule (Lin 2022). A rule, in turn, is triggered when the current behaviour of a user doesn’t match up with their respective behaviour profile (Lin 2022). When a rule is triggered, it will have a risk score for the behaviour scenario(s) that occurred in that rule - with the risk score indicating the severity of the threat (Lin 2022). This all establishes a baseline of what is normal for each user, in combination with the information regarding their previous digital activity (Lin 2022).  </p>
