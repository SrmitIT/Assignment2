								<p> 22 Questions Asked for IT Professionals and Answers</p>
									<ol>
										<li>What is your job title?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo Imperial’s job title is a “Senior Pricing Analyst” </p>
										<li>What company do you work for?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo Imperial works full time at “NAB (National Bank of Australia)” </p>
										<li>What IT field/industry are you in and the department or division that you work for within the company?</li>
										<p> A: As a senior pricing analyst Arceo is in the “Business and private banking area” specifically falling under “pricing capability” of the department.</p>
										<li>What tasks does your job require you to do?</li>
										<p> A: The following tasks are what Arceo Imperial does on a daily basis at NAB: He goes through the “financial products” (term deposits) and prices each of those products by “get[ting] the data from [their] database” and “using software like SAS, SQL and then visual BASIC”. He will then “come up with recommendations” for each of the customers. Pricing each of those products is done through “running scripts and developing those scripts” on a regular basis. </p>
										<li>What other IT departments/divisions do you interact or collaborate with in your job?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo mainly interacts with the business and private banking area, where all the bankers sometimes come to Arceo to “inquire on certain things” and the data that Arceo provides through reports “they use for their job”. Hence, the data consumption provided by Arceo is mainly used in the business and private banking areas. </p>
										<li>What are the difficult parts of your job?</li>
										<p> A: Because Arceo uses a lot of different softwares and scripts the main issue that occurs for him is the “unexpected termination of certain scripts”. When he runs a script he runs them in a sequence and adds certain conditions to them. He mentions that sometimes certain data is not available to him making him have to terminate and restart the whole process. Even though most of this is automatic, he mentions he needs to manually intervene to fix the issue. </p>
										<li>How do you deal with deadlines?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo has to deal with deadlines on a regular basis as the software he works on is used around Australia by the customers. He mentions that “We have this thing called Bank bill swap rate and it comes out every at around 10:00 or 11:11 o'clock in the morning every day” which he needs to allocate top priority to get the most current data for his customers. </p>
										<li>Do you work in a team?</li>
										<p> A: He works with six other IT professionals in a team who each “have specialized skills in [his] area”. For example, some people in his team “[do] a power BI or power query” - and while he also does that, “they divide [their]script so that certain specialized people do certain specialized tasks to make life easier”. </p>
										<li>What does your team rely on you for?</li>
										<p> A: When working in a team, he mentions that "if there's an issue in a certain area where I specialize in, then they will call me to sort that out". Vice versa, if he needs help with a certain problem, he will call the person who specializes in it. </p>
										<li>What apps do you use to work with other members in your team?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo mostly uses teams as it allows him to “see each other (members), and share the environment”. </p>
										<li>What software do you use?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo uses software like SQL at NAB, specifically four of them. These include: “sequel server, we have Oracle, we have SAS, and then we have Microsoft Access SQL”. SQL is the main software that is being used in his company. However, he also uses Visual Basic and Excel alongside SQL and SAS. </p>
										<li>How do you ensure that your data is secure?</li>
										<p> A: The security of the data is taken care of by another department which involves many different stages to help protect the data, as mentioned by Arceo “this can be from logging in and from accessing our hardware”. However, this isn’t his department and involves a separate body of the company. </p>
										<li>What do you use to backup your data?</li>
										<p> A: The backing up of the data is once again done by a separate department, but he also tends to backup his own softwares etc. </p>
										<li>What is employability like in the IT industry? What was the hiring process like for you?</li>
										<p> A: Before Arceo got into NAB he worked at another job. He later directly applied to NAB through SEEK. The employability rate relating to IT is high as he mentions that “If you have the right skills, they'll really grab you. They were even accepting trainees, you know. So yeah, it's really good.” Especially in the data field like system analyst, data analyst and networking he mentions they are hiring at a high rate. </p>
										<li>What position did you start off as (previous jobs and/or internship)?</li>
										<p> A: In Arceo career in Australia he started off as a software engineer with unisys, then moved to price water house as a consultant with banking and then he worked a few years at different banks as consultant and analysts. </p>
										<li>What is the work environment like?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo enjoys the work environment in NAB as he mentions “You get to interact with people, and if there are problems, we sort it out among ourselves and the employer is really good”. Relationships with his colleagues are really good as he goes out to do extracurricular activities with them, which is all covered by the company </p>
										<li>When working from home what are the necessary peripherals required when working in IT?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo says he uses multiple monitors and a laptop with the necessary specs to run all of his requirements.  </p>
										<li>How do you ensure that your IT skills/knowledge are up to date?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo likes to keep up to date by reading materials and keeping up with the latest technologies. He also mentions he has qualifications regarding "SAS Certified developer" and “Certified cloud practitioner” just to keep up to date. Even though he has expert knowledge in SQL, he mentions he still brushes up with SQL and is constantly looking for new things to make himself better. Furthermore, he reads up on programming languages like Python, though he doesn't use it a lot. His main advice to keep up to date with IT is, "So yeah, the bottom line is you keep reading when you have the time, knowing new things, looking at what's out there."  </p>
										<li>What does a work day/week in your life look like?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo mentions he likes to start early because of some scripts he wants to run and get out of the way. As he is supporting three databases, he ensures that each system is running without issues. Sometimes he has scheduled meetings throughout the day that he attends and runs through. Finally, at the end of the day, he clocks out if he can't see any more issues with the system. If an issue does arise, he says that "I'm always in touch with the people, via teams, and I'm in the chat all the time so I can see what's happening." </p>
										<li>What IT certifications do you have?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo has a “SAS Certified developer” which is needed for a SAS developer. He mentions it's important to have a diploma to help show that you have the necessary capability to do what you have to do in the field. Furthermore, he has also done a “Certified Cloud Practitioner” as he mentions, “just so that I'm also up to date with the cloud technology.” Relevant certifications should be sought out instead of unrelated certifications to your field, as Arceo says it can cause people to forget what they learned in the certification. </p>
										<li>How many coding languages do you know?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo knows many different types of programming languages, which his journey began with Cobol. He later learned link, C, VB, VBA, Java, Python, HTML, AngularJS. Due to a large span of time not using some of these programming languages he mentions he needs to go back and refresh his memory. Currently, the most he uses in his workplace is SQL, VBA and SAS. </p>
										<li>What have you learned from mistakes you made while working?</li>
										<p> A: Arceo mentions that If you have programmed something and thoroughly checked through your code that it is working, avoid the mistake of trying to change it last minute. This has caused some issues for Arceo , as sometimes he would find a better last-minute logic that can be applied; however, after making the quick change, it led to the code not working. So it is important not to make any rational decisions last minute to make changes without properly going through the code. </p>
